### Этапы создания ПО
1. Customer gives some vague description of what his business has to achieve.
2. Account manager starts working with customer, discusses project specifications, together they try to figure out what the completed project would look like.
3. Manager starts to discuss project's tasks with project managers and also with developers, together they come up with possible ideas to solve the problem.
4. Next step account manager approves the requirements with customer, then contract is being created.
5. Then PM split overall problem into tasks, and assign them to developers.
6. Developers do their job, when done, pass results to QA team for testing, if tests failed, task goes back to developers to be fixed, if tests were passed successfully particular task goes to PM, everything is being tested again with customer.
7. If customer accepts results, then overall process is repeated with next tasks.
8. Don't have any clue where DevOps should take part in this process, I'm not DevOps yet, so I hope it is going to be clearer as we go through this course.
